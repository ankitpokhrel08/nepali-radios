The backend is implemented using Flask and consists of:
- RESTful API endpoint at `/data`
- JSON-based data storage
- Error handling for file not found (404) and malformed JSON (400)

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with modern React practices:
- Component-based architecture 
- Context API for state management
- Responsive design using TailwindCSS
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
